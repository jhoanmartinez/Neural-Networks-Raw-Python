# Neural-Networks-Raw-Python
This repository is dedicated to building neural networks from scratch in raw Python, which means we will implement all the necessary components, including data preprocessing, weight initialization, feedforward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. By working with the fundamental building blocks of neural networks.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of neural networks from scratch. We believe that understanding the inner workings of neural networks is essential for gaining a deeper insight into their behavior and achieving better performance.

By building neural networks from scratch, we can explore various concepts such as feedforward and backpropagation, activation functions, weight initialization, gradient descent, and more. Additionally, this project serves as a valuable resource for learning Python programming and strengthening your understanding of neural networks.
